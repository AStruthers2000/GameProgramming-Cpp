/**
* Core of the Genetic Algorithm.
* This function instantiates a Vehicle, that will simulate driving each of the routes, 
* as well as vectors that will hold the current generation and their fitnesses.
* The function first creates a population of #POPULATION_SIZE by randomly generating valid 
* tours through each of the customer nodes and calculates the fitness of each. Then the code 
* iterates for #MAX_GENERATIONS iterations, performing Tournament Selection, Single Point Crossover,
* and Mutation to generate a new population of #POPULATION_SIZE. Fitnesses of each of the children 
* are calculated via the Vehicle class. At the end of the generations, the child with the lowest 
* fitness is returned. The tour with the lowest distance at the end of #MAX_GENERATIONS should 
* be the most optimal route through each of the customer nodes.
* 
* Each tour is represented by a vector of ints, where each int is the index of a customer node in 
* the vector of all nodes. We only consider solutions that include 1 of each customer node as "valid"
* due to the restrictions of the EVRP. Since there is no requirement to visit each of the charging stations
* or the depot if we don't have to, solutions take the form of the order in which the Vehicle should visit
* each customer node. The Vehicle class will take the proposed tour and calculate the true distance of that
* route through simulation, stopping at a charging station or the depot whenever the proposed route demands it
* (ran out of inventory or needs to recharge battery before getting stranded). 
* 
* The fitness of each solution is represented by the true distance of the route as simulated by the Vehicle class.
* We seek to minimize the true distance through a Genetic Algorithm approach. 
*
